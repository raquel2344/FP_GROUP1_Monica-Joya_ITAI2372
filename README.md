Project Description
Mission Resource Optimization AI for Artemis Lunar Operations

This project presents a conceptual AI system designed to optimize critical resource consumption (water, oxygen, food, and power) during NASA's Artemis lunar missions. The system addresses the challenge of sustainable resource management for long-duration lunar stays, directly supporting NASA's goal of establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon as preparation for Mars missions.

Project Overview
The Mission Resource Optimization AI (MROI) is an intelligent decision-support system that:
- Monitors real-time resource consumption patterns
- Predicts future resource needs based on mission activities
- Recommends optimal resource allocation strategies
- Provides early warning alerts for potential shortages
- Adapts to changing mission parameters and crew behaviors

Project Motivation
Based on NASA guest speaker Lynn Vernon's presentation on October 24, 2024, resource management emerged as a critical challenge for Artemis missions. The presentation highlighted that sustainable lunar operations require:
- Water ice extraction and recycling
- Oxygen production from lunar resources
- Efficient food storage and consumption
- Power management for life support systems

Key Innovation
Unlike existing resource management systems that operate reactively, MROI uses predictive AI to anticipate resource needs before critical situations arise. This proactive approach is essential for missions where resupply from Earth takes days and costs millions of dollars per kilogram.
