# Project Proposal: Mission Resource Optimization AI

## Executive Summary

The Mission Resource Optimization AI (MROI) addresses one of NASA's most critical challenges for Artemis lunar missions: sustainable resource management during extended lunar operations. This conceptual AI system will predict, monitor, and optimize the consumption of essential resources (water, oxygen, food, and power) to ensure mission success and crew safety.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenge
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon, with missions potentially lasting weeks or months. Unlike the Apollo missions' brief stays, Artemis requires careful management of:

- **Water**: Essential for drinking, food preparation, and oxygen production
- **Oxygen**: Critical for breathing and EVA operations  
- **Food**: Limited storage capacity with no resupply options
- **Power**: Needed for life support, equipment, and communication systems

### Why This Matters
- Resupply missions cost approximately $10,000 per kilogram
- Resource shortages could force early mission termination
- Emergency situations require immediate resource reallocation
- Manual resource tracking is error-prone and time-consuming

### Inspiration from NASA
During Lynn Vernon's presentation, he emphasized that NASA's core mission includes "resource utilization" as a key Artemis objective, specifically mentioning:
- Water ice extraction
- Oxygen production  
- Fuel generation
- Long-term sustainability

## Proposed Solution

### AI System Overview
MROI is an intelligent decision-support system that uses machine learning to:

1. **Monitor**: Real-time tracking of resource consumption rates
2. **Predict**: Forecast future needs based on planned activities
3. **Optimize**: Recommend efficient resource allocation strategies
4. **Alert**: Provide early warnings for potential shortages
5. **Adapt**: Learn from crew behavior and adjust recommendations

### Key Features

#### Predictive Analytics Engine
- Analyzes historical consumption patterns
- Factors in planned mission activities (EVAs, experiments, maintenance)
- Accounts for crew size and individual consumption rates
- Considers equipment efficiency and degradation over time

#### Optimization Algorithm
- Balances competing resource needs
- Prioritizes critical life support functions
- Suggests conservation measures when needed
- Optimizes timing for resource-intensive activities

#### Intelligent Alerting System
- Provides graduated warnings (green/yellow/red status)
- Calculates time to critical resource levels
- Suggests specific conservation actions
- Integrates with mission planning systems

## Technical Approach

### AI Methodology
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised learning for consumption prediction
- **Optimization**: Linear programming for resource allocation
- **Data Analysis**: Time series analysis for pattern recognition
- **Decision Trees**: Rule-based system for alert generation

### Data Sources
- Historical mission consumption data (ISS, previous lunar missions)
- Equipment specifications and efficiency ratings
- Crew activity schedules and metabolic requirements
- Environmental factors (temperature, EVA frequency)

### Algorithm Selection
**Primary**: Random Forest Regression for consumption prediction
- Handles multiple variables effectively
- Robust to outliers
- Provides feature importance rankings
- Works well with limited training data

**Secondary**: Linear Programming for optimization
- Proven mathematical approach
- Handles constraints effectively
- Computationally efficient
- Transparent decision-making process

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- 15-20% reduction in resource waste through optimized consumption
- Early warning system prevents critical shortages
- Automated monitoring reduces crew workload
- Data-driven decisions improve mission planning

### Long-term Impact
